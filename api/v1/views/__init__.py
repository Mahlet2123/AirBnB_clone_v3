""" Here we create blueprint object.
The app_views blueprint object acts as a container that holds all
the routes defined across multiple modules. It provides a consistent
URL prefix (/api/v1) and other settings for those routes. Once we
register the app_views blueprint with our Flask application, all the
routes defined within the associated modules will be accessible through
the URL prefix(/api/v1) defined in the app_views blueprint.
